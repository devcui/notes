##  What is node-oidc-provider


node-oidc-provider is a certified OpenID Connect implementation for Node.js. It's an npm package that allows developers to implement OpenID Connect Identity Providers (OP) in their Node.js applications.

This library provides a flexible and feature-rich implementation that supports various OpenID Connect flows and extensions, including:

- Authorization Code Flow
- Implicit Flow
- Hybrid Flow
- Client Credentials
- Device Authorization Grant
- Refresh Tokens
- Session Management

It's widely used for building authentication and authorization services that need to comply with the OpenID Connect standard, allowing secure identity verification and token-based authentication.

## How should I learn node-oidc-provider

First look for examples to see how others use it. Find entry points from examples then examine the code to understand what each piece of code does. Learn about OIDC during this process.

## Concepts

OIDC builds on OAuth 2.0 to add identity verification. Here's an overview of the main flows based on different grant types:

### Authorization Code Flow

- Most common and secure flow
- **Process**:
    1. User accesses your application
    2. Your app redirects to the identity provider (IdP) with client ID, redirect URI, scope (including "openid"), etc.
    3. User authenticates on the IdP
    4. IdP redirects back to your app with an authorization code
    5. Your backend exchanges the code for tokens (access token, ID token, and refresh token)
    6. You validate the tokens and use the ID token for user identity information

### Implicit Flow

- For browser-based applications without a backend
- Less secure than Authorization Code Flow
- **Process**: Similar to Authorization Code Flow but IdP returns tokens directly in the URL fragment

### Client Credentials Flow

- For server-to-server communication
- No user involved
- **Process**: Your application requests tokens directly using client ID and secret
### Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow

- Should be avoided when possible
- **Process**: User provides username/password directly to your application, which exchanges them for tokens
### Device Authorization Flow

- For devices with limited input capabilities
- **Process**: Device displays a code, user enters it on a different device, then tokens are issued
### Key OIDC Concepts

- **ID Token**: JWT containing user identity information
- **UserInfo Endpoint**: Additional user details can be retrieved with the access token
- **Scopes**: Determine what information you can access (e.g., "openid profile email")


## Example

[oidc-example](https://github.com/ebrahimmfadae/openid-connect-app.git)

```
- api: test oauth api(mix token or return 401)
- app: oauth client,includes login,register......
- oidc: oauth provider(oauth server)
```


### First look at oidc

```typescript
const start = async () => {
	await connectMongodb()

	const app = new Koa()
	render(app, {
		cache: false,
		viewExt: 'ejs',
		layout: false,
		root: path.resolve('oidc/src/views'),
	})

	const provider = oidc(process.env.OIDC_ISSUER as string, configuration)

	app.use(koaStatic(path.resolve('public')))
	app.use(router(provider).routes())
	app.use(mount(provider.app))

	app.listen(process.env.PORT, () => {
		console.log(`oidc-provider listening on port ${process.env.PORT}`)
	})
}

void start()
```

- Connect to MongoDB
- Create a Koa app
- Set up the EJS template engine
	- root: add views
- Initialize the OIDC provider with the issuer from environment variables and configuration
- Serve static files from the 'public' directory
- Use the routes defined for the OIDC provider
- Mount the OIDC provider application
- Start the server and listen on the port defined in environment variables
- Immediately invoke the start function without handling its promise

### Then look at app

### Then look at api
